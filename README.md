# OPTIMIZING-EMPLOYEE-ATTRITION-PREDICTION-THROUGH-ADVANCED-ANALYTICS
The overarching goal of this project was to employ the HR Analytics data set to uncover the determinants of employee attrition within a company. Through meticulous data processing, feature engineering, and the application of multiple predictive modeling techniques

Predict Employee Attrition: Utilize advanced machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to create robust models capable of predicting the likelihood of employee turnover. This objective was pursued with the intention of enabling preemptive interventions for at-risk employees.

Identify Key Attrition Factors: Through exploratory data analysis, correlation matrix inspection, and the interpretation of model feature importances, pinpoint the most influential factors contributing to employee attrition. Special attention was given to variables such as OverTime, JobLevel, TotalWorkingYears, and StockOptionLevel, which were hypothesized and later confirmed to have significant impacts on attrition rates.

Optimize Model Performance: Methodically tune hyperparameters for each model to optimize their performance. This included experimenting with different split ratios to balance training and testing data, regularizing logistic regression to prevent overfitting, and adjusting parameters for the Random Forest and XGBoost models to enhance their predictive accuracy and generalization to unseen data.

Cross-Model Comparisons: Compare the effectiveness of different modeling approaches in predicting attrition, utilizing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. This comparison was aimed at identifying the most suitable model or models for deployment in real-world HR analytics applications.

Provide Actionable Insights: Translate the analytical findings into actionable recommendations for HR practices, including targeted retention strategies, tailored employee engagement programs, and personalized career development plans for employees identified as high risk for attrition.
